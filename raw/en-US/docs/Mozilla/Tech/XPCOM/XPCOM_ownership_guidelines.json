If you create a temporary object, obviously it's up to you to destroy it. That's a sure sign of ownership. If you create an object with a longer lifespan, you will own it until you give ownership away.</p>\n\n<p>All \"factory\" and \"getter\" functions produce owning pointers.</p>\n\n<p>Such a function is the perfect example of something that creates an object with a longer lifespan that itself, and gives away ownership (by producing a pointer that is already <code>AddRef</code>ed) --- in this case, to the caller. This is terrific for factory functions, but can be problematic for mere getters. It's unfortunate if you just needed access to it for a moment. In the latter case, caching the pointer you got back makes you a de facto owner. This may not be appropriate; and it may be hard to remedy without knowing if the object in question was truly created in response to your query.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Needing_it_isn.27t.2C_by_itself.2C_a_valid_reason_for_owning_it.\" name=\"Needing_it_isn.27t.2C_by_itself.2C_a_valid_reason_for_owning_it.\">Needing it isn't, by itself, a valid reason for owning it.</h3>\n\n<p>You don't own an object because <strong>you</strong> need <strong>it</strong>. In fact often you own it because <strong>it</strong> needs <strong>you</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"If_you_own_it.2C_it_shouldn.27t_own_you.\" name=\"If_you_own_it.2C_it_shouldn.27t_own_you.\">If you own <strong>it</strong>, it shouldn't own <strong>you</strong>.</h3>\n\n<p>Even transitively. Or put another way: the ownership graph for any system should be acyclic. Anytime there is a cycle of ownership, there is a situation that isn't automatically handled by destructors. Special code must be provided and called to break the cycle before the participants can be individually released.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"You_don.27t_need_to_own_it_if_it.27s_lifetime_is_guaranteed_to_be_longer_than_yours.\" name=\"You_don.27t_need_to_own_it_if_it.27s_lifetime_is_guaranteed_to_be_longer_than_yours.\">You don't need to own it if it's lifetime is guaranteed to be longer than yours.</h3>\n\n<p>As for instance, when it owns you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Parents_own_their_children_.28and_not_the_reverse.29.\" name=\"Parents_own_their_children_.28and_not_the_reverse.29.\">Parents own their children (and not the reverse).</h3>\n\n<p>Though parents may not <strong>need</strong> to own their children. For instance, a tree may own all the nodes that are in it. All the nodes in the tree point to each other with non-owning pointers. In the simplest scheme, however, parents point to their children with owning-pointers, children point back to their parents with non-owning-pointers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Containers_own_the_things_they_contain_.28and_not_the_reverse.29.\" name=\"Containers_own_the_things_they_contain_.28and_not_the_reverse.29.\">Containers own the things they contain (and not the reverse).</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"Use_nsCOMPtrs_to_implement_owning-pointers.\" name=\"Use_nsCOMPtrs_to_implement_owning-pointers.\">Use <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s to implement owning-pointers.</h3>\n\n<p>It's explicit, efficient, and fairly bullet-proof. It's easier to write `getter's and `setter's; and you don't need to put anything in your destructor.</p>\n\n<div class=\"originaldocinfo\">\n<h2 id=\"Original_Document_Information\" name=\"Original_Document_Information\">Original Document Information</h2>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Author: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meer.net/ScottCollins/\">Scott Collins</a></li>\n <li>Last Updated Date: May 8, 2003</li>\n <li>Copyright Information: Copyright© 1999 by Netscape; use is subject to the <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/\">NPL</a>.
