It is a template class that acts, syntactically, just like an ordinary pointer in C or C++, i.e., you can apply <code>*</code> or <code>-&gt;</code> to it to \"get to\" what it points at. <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is smart in that, unlike a raw C++ pointer to an XPCOM object, <code>nsCOMPtr</code> manages <code>AddRef</code>, <code>Release</code>, and <code>QueryInterface</code> for you. <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is defined in the source files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><code><a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/glue/nsCOMPtr.h\" rel=\"custom\">xpcom/glue/nsCOMPtr.h</a></code></li>\n <li><code><a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/glue/nsCOMPtr.cpp\" rel=\"custom\">xpcom/glue/nsCOMPtr.cpp</a></code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...though you probably don't want to look in there, just yet.</p>\n\n<p>With <code>nsCOMPtr</code>, you can write code that is shorter, cleaner, clearer, and safer, than you can with raw XPCOM interface pointers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\".5BXP.5DCOM_Basics:_Ownership_and_Reference_Counting\" name=\".5BXP.5DCOM_Basics:_Ownership_and_Reference_Counting\">XPCOM Basics: Ownership and Reference Counting</h4>\n\n<p>This is a quick refresher on some fundamental issues of XPCOM. You should already know this, and should be able to just skim this short section. If this is unfamiliar material, you're not ready for <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s yet. A good place to learn about the basic rules and reasoning behind COM is in <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201634465\">Essential COM</a> by <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.develop.com/dbox/\">Don Box</a>. Don Box gets into more of the details, traps, and pitfalls of COM in <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201379686\">Effective COM</a>. You should also have a reasonable knowledge of C++. Probably the three most helpful books on this topic are <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201889544\">The C++ Programming Language</a> by Bjarne Stroustrup, <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201924889\">Effective C++</a>, and <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020163371X\">More Effective C++</a> by Scott Meyers.</p>\n\n<p>All XPCOM objects are allocated on the heap. Clients don't get to know much about the implementation of any such object. They reference it only through a pointer to an `interface', i.e., the static type of the pointer is a pointer to an abstract base class, the actual object pointed to is a class derived from that abstract base class. The XPCOM object is said to `implement that interface'. The client's reference to the object is typically called `an interface pointer'.</p>\n\n<p>An object may implement many interfaces. Each interface is (at least conceptually) separately `reference counted'. That is, the interface keeps a count of the number of clients holding references to it. When that count goes to zero, the interface may <code>delete</code> itself. Clients are expected to keep this reference count accurate by incrementing it when they acquire a reference to the interface, and decrementing it before they let go. To facilitate this, all interfaces inherit from an abstract base class that provides the member functions <code>AddRef</code>, and <code>Release</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A rule of XPCOM is that any function that creates or returns an interface pointer will have already <code>AddRef</code>ed it. The caller can then hold onto the reference indefinitely, calling <code>Release</code> when it no longer needs it. When the last pointer to an interface is <code>Release</code>d, the interface (and consequently, typically the underlying object) will <code>delete</code> itself. As long as there is an outstanding <code>AddRef</code> against the interface, it continues to exist. If you forget to call <code>Release</code>, the object will leak, i.e., the storage for that object will never be reclaimed. Leaks are bad <code><span class=\"nowiki\">:-)</span></code>.</p>\n\n<p>A reference through which you will call <code>AddRef</code> and <code>Release</code> is called an <strong>owning reference</strong>. It holds a stake in the underlying object. That object cannot go away until the owning reference has relinquished its claim. Not all references need to be owning references. In fact, if two objects somehow end up owning each other (even transitively) it becomes difficult for either of those object to be reclaimed without adding some `out-of-band' mechanism for breaking the ownership cycle. The document <a href=\"/en-US/docs/XPCOM_ownership_guidelines\">Some COM Ownership Guidelines</a> provides some hints on when ownership is needed. The following lists are good starting point, but by no means complete.</p>\n\n<p>You use an owning reference when</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>you created the object;</li>\n <li>you got the object from a function that <em>might</em> have created it, e.g., any `getter' function, such as <code>QueryInterface</code>, or <code>CreateInstance</code>. All good getters <code>AddRef</code> the interface pointers they produce, thus providing you with an owning reference;</li>\n <li>you will hold onto the reference longer than the scope of the function in which you acquired it, e.g., you got it as a parameter, but you're hanging onto it in a member variable (see, for example, <a href=\"#Comparison_1\">Comparison 1</a>, below).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You don't need an owning reference when</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>the object is passed in as a parameter, and you <em>don't</em> need to keep it any longer than the scope of this function;</li>\n <li>the object's lifetime is known to contain yours in some well defined way, e.g., in the nodes of a tree, parent nodes keep owning references to their children, children need not keep owning references to their parents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It turns out that reference counting by hand is hard for programmers to get right. It may sound simple, but in practice it's very easy to forget to <code>Release</code> at the appropriate moment. Or to <code>AddRef</code> too many or too few times.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"How_does_nsCOMPtr_help.3F\" name=\"How_does_nsCOMPtr_help.3F\">How does <code>nsCOMPtr</code> help?</h4>\n\n<p><code>nsCOMPtr</code> manages <code>AddRef</code>, <code>Release</code>, and other red-tape for you. An <code>nsCOMPtr</code> looks and acts as much like a raw XPCOM interface pointer as C allows, but it knows it owns the object it points to. This takes a little getting used to on your part, but ends up with less typing, clearer, safer code, and less leaks.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, here is a typical snippet of code (at its most compact) where you assign a XPCOM interface pointer into a member variable, i.e., the body of a `setter' function, side-by-side using raw XPCOM interface pointers and <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s.</p>\n\n<table id=\"Comparison_1\">\n <caption><a id=\"Comparison_1\" name=\"Comparison_1\">Comparison 1.

With <code>nsCOMPtr</code>, you may never have to call <code>AddRef</code>, <code>Release</code>, or <code>QueryInterface</code> by hand.</p>\n\n<p>You still have to understand XPCOM. You still have to know which functions return interface pointers that have already been <code>AddRef</code>ed and which don't. You still have to ensure your program logic doesn't produce circularly referencing garbage. <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is not a panacea. It is, however, helpful, easy to use, well-tested, and polite. It doesn't require that a function author cooperate with you, nor does your use force others to use it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Using_nsCOMPtr\" name=\"Using_nsCOMPtr\">Using <code>nsCOMPtr</code></h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"The_Basics\" name=\"The_Basics\">The Basics</h4>\n\n<p>In most cases, you'll use an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> exactly as you would a raw XPCOM interface pointer. Note the slight difference in declaration.</p>\n\n<table id=\"Comparison_2\">\n <caption><a id=\"Comparison_2\" name=\"Comparison_2\">Comparison 2. Similarities: <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is syntactically similar to raw XPCOM interface pointers.</a></caption>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\n// raw XPCOM interface pointers...\n\nnsIFoo* fooPtr = 0;\n // ...\nfooPtr-&gt;SomeFunction(x, y, z);\nAnotherFunction(fooPtr);\n\nif ( fooPtr )\n  // ...\n\nif ( fooPtr == foo2Ptr )\n  // ...\n</pre>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\n// |nsCOMPtr|...\n\nnsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; fooPtr;\n// ...\nfooPtr-&gt;SomeFunction(x, y, z);\nAnotherFunction(fooPtr);\n\nif ( fooPtr )\n  // ...\n\nif ( fooPtr == foo2Ptr )\n  // ...\n</pre>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>There are two main differences. First: you no longer need, nor are you allowed, to call <code>AddRef</code> or <code>Release</code>.</p>\n\n<table id=\"Comparison_3\">\n <caption><a id=\"Comparison_3\" name=\"Comparison_3\">Comparison 3.

You have to `annotate' the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> with the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#.60Out.27_Parameters:_getter_AddRefs\"><code>getter_AddRefs</code></a> directive.</p>\n\n<table id=\"Comparison_4\">\n <caption><a id=\"Comparison_4\" name=\"Comparison_4\">Comparison 4.

You now know enough to start using <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s. There are a few other details you will want to know as you use <code>nsCOMPtr</code> in more complicated situations, but what you've just learned will cover 90% of your uses.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"A_Few_Details\" name=\"A_Few_Details\">A Few Details</h4>\n\n<p>There are a couple more things that will help you get the most out of <code>nsCOMPtr</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Very often, you first get an interface pointer by calling <code>QueryInterface</code>. <code>QueryInterface</code> is a getter like any other, and you already know one way to call it, applying the <code>getter_AddRefs</code> rule, as described above.</p>\n\n<table>\n <caption>The hard way to <code>QueryInterface</code> into an <code>nsCOMPtr</code>.</caption>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\n// A way (though not the best way) to |QueryInterface| into an |nsCOMPtr|...\n\nnsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; foo;\n\nnsresult rv = bar-&gt;QueryInterface(NS_GET_IID(nsIFoo), getter_AddRefs(foo));\n\n  // Or, if you're a savvy XPCOM programmer,\n  //  you use the type-safe version...\nnsresult rv = CallQueryInterface(bar, getter_AddRefs(foo));\n</pre>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><code>QueryInterface</code> is used so frequently, though, that <code>nsCOMPtr</code> has a special facility to call it. This facility is type-safe, and it enables an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> to be directly constructed from the result of <code>QueryInterface</code>. Construction from the correct value is more efficient that construction followed by assignment. This facility is the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_do_QueryInterface.28_nsISupports.2A_.29.2CnsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_do_QueryInterface.28_nsISupports.2A.2C_nsresult.2A_.29\"><code>do_QueryInterface</code></a> directive.

This same favor is <em>not</em> extended to <code>QueryInterface</code>. <code>nsCOMPtr</code> does not <code>QueryInterface</code> on assignment without your explicit permission in the form of the <code>do_QueryInterface</code> directive. You need never worry about hidden queries. However, be aware that if you <em>should</em> have queried but didn't, e.g., when assigning in a raw pointer where C++ allows the assignment, but XPCOM wouldn't, <code>nsCOMPtr</code> will <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#Type_Safeguards\">assert at runtime</a>. Use <code>do_QueryInterface</code> whenever you assign in a pointer to a XPCOM interface of a different type, even if that type happens to derive from the base type of the <code>nsCOMPtr</code></p>\n\n<table id=\"Comparison_6\">\n <caption><a id=\"Comparison_6\" name=\"Comparison_6\">Comparison 6. <code>do_QueryInterface</code> prevents XPCOM type errors.</a></caption>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\nclass nsIBar\n  : public nsIFoo ... { ... };\n\nnsIBar* p = ...;\n\n  // C++ thinks every |nsIBar*| is an\n  //  |nsIFoo*|, therefore, C++ allows\n  //  this...\nnsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; foo = p;\n  //  ...even though it is an XPCOM\n  //  type error\n</pre>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\nclass nsIBar\n  : public nsIFoo ... { ... };\n\nnsIBar* p = ...;\n\n\n\n  // No type error here...\nnsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; foo(do_QueryInterface(p));\n\n\n\n\n</pre>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Remember, the C++ type system and the XPCOM type system are really two independent things. Because XPCOM interfaces are expressed as abstract C++ base classes, you may be tempted to let C++ handle the differences, or to use C++ casts to navigate between interface types. This is wrong. The only sanctioned way to get between XPCOM types is with <code>QueryInterface</code>. In the example above, there is no reason to assume that the <code>nsIFoo*</code> C++ pulls out of <code>p</code> would be the same one that <code>p-&gt;QueryInterface()</code> would return.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_dont_AddRef.28_T.2A_.29.2CnsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_getter_AddRefs.28_T.2A_.29\"><code>dont_AddRef</code></a> is a similar directive that helps you when you assign in a pointer that has already been <code>AddRef</code>ed, e.g., because you called a getter that returned the pointer as its function result.</p>\n\n<table>\n <caption>Using <code>dont_AddRef</code>.</caption>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\nnsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; foo(dont_AddRef(CreateFoo()));\n  // |CreateFoo| |AddRef|s its result, as all good getters do\n</pre>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h4 id=\"Something_nsCOMPtr_Doesn.27t_Do\" name=\"Something_nsCOMPtr_Doesn.27t_Do\">Something <code>nsCOMPtr</code> <em>Doesn't</em> Do</h4>\n\n<p>An <code>nsCOMPtr</code> does all that is necessary to behave as an owning reference. A given <code>nsCOMPtr</code> does not, however, cooperate in making <em>other</em> owning pointers. After learning how <code>nsCOMPtr</code> automatically <code>AddRef</code>s a pointer as it is being assigned <em>in</em>, the natural assumption is that it does the same thing when assigning <em>out</em>. Here is a snippet of code that demonstrates this misconception.</p>\n\n<table>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\n// Incorrect assumptions about |nsCOMPtr|...\n\nnsresult\nnsCacheRecord::GetFileSpec( nsIFileSpec** aFileSpec )\n    /*\n      ...fills in the callers |nsFileSpec*| (which the caller supplied\n      the address of) with a copy of my member variable |mFileSpec|,\n      an |nsCOMPtr|.

This is <em>not</em> the case. An <code>nsCOMPtr</code> automatically calls <code>AddRef</code> and <code>Release</code> (only) on its <em>own</em> behalf. In all other situations, it is designed to be a drop in replacement for a raw XPCOM pointer. Where ever an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is used in a situation where a raw pointer is needed, the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> automatically provides one.</p>\n\n<table>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <pre class=\"brush: cpp\">\n// |nsCOMPtr| produces a raw pointer when needed...\n\nnsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; foo = ...;\n\n  // 1.

In each case, you are essentially extracting the raw pointer value for your own purpose. If the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> <code>AddRef</code>ed the value each time you did that, cases 4 and 5 would obviously always generate leaks. <code>SetFoo</code>, from case 3, would have to be written two different ways when given an <code>nsCOMPtr</code>, it would know the value was already <code>AddRef</code>ed, and when given a raw pointer it would assume the value was not <code>AddRef</code>ed. Actually the contradictions run deeper than that. All these cases show that automatically <code>AddRef</code>ing on `output' makes <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s and raw-pointers act differently from the point of view of the clients. The goal is to make them act the same so that <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s can be a drop in replacement (modulo managing its own `ownership').</p>\n\n<p>Given what you now know, the rule is predictable. As described above, and unless you tell it otherwise, an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> <code>AddRef</code>s when you assign <em>in</em> to it. It does nothing when you assign <em>out</em> of it.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"Where_should_I_use_nsCOMPtrs.3F\" name=\"Where_should_I_use_nsCOMPtrs.3F\">Where should I use <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s?</h4>\n\n<p>You should use an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> any place you use an interface pointer as an owning reference, i.e., where you call <code>AddRef</code> and <code>Release</code> on it. You should use <code>nsCOMPtr</code> as a member variable, where it will simplify setters, and eliminate constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.

If you were to use a raw pointer instead, your function couldn't know what ownership relationship the caller had to the input value, and hence, couldn't know whether to <code>Release</code> it or not before assigning in the new value. By declaring the parameter as an <code>nsCOMPtr&amp;</code>, the relationship is explicit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Summary\" name=\"Summary\">Summary</h3>\n\n<p>An <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is an owning reference. Whatever it points to has been <code>AddRef</code>ed, counting the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> as one of its `owners'. An <code>nsCOMPtr</code> always calls <code>Release</code> before letting go, whether the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is letting go so that it can point to a different object, or because the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> is going out of scope. Any time a new value is assigned into an <code>nsCOMPtr</code>, the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> automatically always <code>Release</code>s its old referent, if any, and (unless you tell it you already have) <code>AddRef</code>s the new.</p>\n\n<p>You use an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> exactly as you would a raw XPCOM interface pointer in almost all cases. You won't have to explictly call <code>AddRef</code> or <code>Release</code> through it, nor will the compiler allow it. The only place you can't use an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> without change is where a raw XPCOM interface pointer is an `out' parameter. In this case, you wrap the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> with <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#.60Out.27_Parameters:_getter_AddRefs\"><code>getter_AddRefs</code></a> (see <a href=\"#\">Comparison 4</a>).</p>\n\n<p>When assigning into an <code>nsCOMPtr</code>, you will usually just supply another pointer (either a raw XPCOM interface pointer or an <code>nsCOMPtr</code>), with no additional directives (see, e.g., the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> side of <a href=\"#Comparison_1\">Comparison 1</a>). As stated above, with no directives, the <code>nsCOMPtr</code> will <code>Release</code> its old referent, if any, and <code>AddRef</code> the new. This is appropriate when the thing you're assigning in hasn't yet been <code>AddRef</code>ed to account for the new reference. This is typically the case when you are assigning in a pointer that you <em>didn't</em> call a function to get, e.g., one that was passed in as a parameter, or that you pulled out of a structure.</p>\n\n<p>You can tell <code>nsCOMPtr</code> it doesn't need to <code>AddRef</code> the new value on assignment by wrapping the new value in <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_dont_AddRef.28_T.2A_.29.2CnsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_getter_AddRefs.28_T.2A_.29\"><code>dont_AddRef</code></a>. Do this, for example, when you got the new value from a function which, like all good XPCOM getters, already called <code>AddRef</code> on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>You may not assign in a pointer to a different interface type; you must first query it to the right type (see, e.g., <a href=\"#Comparison_6\">Comparison 6</a> and the surrounding discussion). <code>nsCOMPtr</code> <em>never</em> calls <code>QueryInterface</code> implicitly, i.e., you must call it yourself, or explictly ask <code>nsCOMPtr</code> to call it with <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_do_QueryInterface.28_nsISupports.2A_.29.2CnsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_do_QueryInterface.28_nsISupports.2A.2C_nsresult.2A_.29\"><code>do_QueryInterface</code></a>. The <code>do_QueryInterface</code> directive allows you to do the query as part of the assignment. This better facilitates constructing an <code>nsCOMPtr</code> directly from the right value, rather than constructing it and assigning in the correct value later. Construction alone is more efficient than construction followed by assignment. Prefer construction over assignment whereever reasonable. Be careful not to apply <code>do_QueryInterface</code> to a function returning an <code>AddRef</code>ed pointer (see <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual#nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_.3D_.2F.2A_call_QueryInterface_but_don.27t_AddRef_.2A.2F\">this short section</a> for an explanation)</p>\n\n<p>For more details, continue on to the <a href=\"/docs/en-US/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual\" title=\"en/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual\">Reference Manual</a>.</p>",
