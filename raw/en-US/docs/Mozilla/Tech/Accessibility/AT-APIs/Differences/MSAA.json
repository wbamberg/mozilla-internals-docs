The results are always returned via VT_DISPATCH.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">enum { NAVRELATION_LABEL_FOR = 0x1002 };\n\nenum { NAVRELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR = 0x100f };\n</pre>\n\n<p>These two relations can be used on object to determine what form control is being labelled or desribed.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">enum { NAVRELATION_LABELLED_BY = 0x1003 };\n\nenum { NAVRELATION_DESCRIBED_BY = 0x100e };\n</pre>\n\n<p>These two relations are they inverse; they can be used on form controls. If the form control has an accName, you can get the IAccessible that it was labelled by in order to get more formatting information. It is also useful to check for a description.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the label and description relations may be used to prevent redundant information from being presented by the screen reader, since the label and description can occur both on their own, and in the name or description fields of an IAccessible.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">enum { NAVRELATION_DEFAULT_BUTTON = 0x100d };\n</pre>\n\n<p>When used within an HTML form or a XUL dialog, the NAVRELATION_DEFAULT_BUTTON relation will return the IAccessible for the default button.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">enum { NAVRELATION_EMBEDS = 0x1009 };\n</pre>\n\n<p>This relation is used on the root accessible object for a top level Mozilla window, corresponding to what's returned for OBJID_CLIENT for that window. It points to the accessible object corresponding to the root of content in that window. This relation is very useful for finding the content quickly, and will be the proper method for finding content in Firefox 3 and beyond.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">enum { NAVRELATION_CONTROLLED_BY = 0x1000 };\n\nenum { NAVRELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR = 0x1001 };\n</pre>\n\n<p>These two relations show what form controls may dynamically change areas of the document, in response to user changes in the form controls themselves. Both controlled_by and controller_for are set in markup from the single dynamic content accessibility dynamic content aaa:controls attribute. The inverse controlled_by relation is automatically calculated.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">enum { NAVRELATION_FLOWS_TO = 0x1006 };\n\nenum { NAVRELATION_FLOWS_FROM = 0x1007 };\n</pre>\n\n<p>These two relations allow the reading flow to break out of the normal DOM flow. Both flows_to and flows_from are set in markup from the single dynamic content accessibility aaa:flowsto relation -- the inverse flow_from relation is automatically calculated.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"Checkable.2C_Required_and_Invalid_States_are_Supported\" name=\"Checkable.2C_Required_and_Invalid_States_are_Supported\">Checkable, Required and Invalid States are Supported</h3>\n\n<div class=\"indent\">\n<p>Gecko defines three state constants using previously unused states:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">const unsigned long STATE_CHECKABLE = STATE_MARQUEED; // Useful on menuitem, listitem\n// and treeitem. Indicates that the absence of STATE_CHECKED should be spoken as\n// \"unchecked\", and that EVENT_STATE_CHANGE will be fired in the event that the\n// checkbox is toggled.\n\nconst unsigned long STATE_REQUIRED = STATE_ALERT_LOW;  // Used on form controls\n// to indicate that this field must be filled out to submit the form\n\nconst unsigned long STATE_INVALID = STATE_ALERT_HIGH;  // Used on form controls to\n// indicate the the field does not currently have a legal value\n\nconst unsigned long STATE_??? = STATE_ALERT_MEDIUM; // Reserved for future use.\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"Document_Structure_Exposed_in_MSAA_Tree\" name=\"Document_Structure_Exposed_in_MSAA_Tree\">Document Structure Exposed in MSAA Tree</h3>\n\n<div class=\"indent\">\n<p>BSTR roles are used for important roles that have not been defined by Microsoft. When the role is retrieved in a VARIANT returned from get_accRole, check to see if variant.vt == VT_BSTR. If it is, than variant.bstrVal contains the role string.</p>\n\n<p>The role string may be an HTML tag name followed by comma, space and the namespace of the current element. In most current cases the namespace can be ignored, but it may become important in the future. The following HTML tags are exposed as BSTR's:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"eval\">abbr, acronym, blockquote, dd, dl, dt, form, frame, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,\n iframe, q, tbody, tfoot, thead\n</pre>\n\n<p>In addition, an HTML list uses the <code>bullet</code> BSTR role to expose bullets and numbers that are automatically inserted into the formatting by Gecko. In addition, ROLE_LIST with STATE_READONLY and ROLE_LISTITEM are used to expose the list structure. This makes it important to check the STATE_READONLY flag when encountering a ROLE_LIST, because the HTML list form element also uses ROLE_LIST, but without STATE_READONLY set.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"Positional_Descriptions_are_Supported\" name=\"Positional_Descriptions_are_Supported\">Positional Descriptions are Supported</h3>\n\n<div class=\"indent\">\n<p>The accDescription field is overriden for the following roles:</p>\n\n<p>ROLE_LISTITEM, ROLE_MENUITEM, ROLE_RADIOBUTTON, ROLE_PAGETAB and ROLE_OUTLINEITEM</p>\n\n<p>For everything other than outline item, the positional description is in the form \"n of m\" where n is an integer indicating the position within other similar objects in a group, and m represents the number of objects in that group. For example, \"3 of 5\" indicates the 3rd object out of 5.</p>\n\n<p>For outline item, more information is provided, in a format that reads \"L#, n of m with c\" where # represents the level that the outline item is at, and c represents the number of children. The n of m position relates to the position within the current outline level.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, true descriptions are now exposed with the text \"Description: \" prepending the description. This makes it clear that the description is truly intended to be read. Neither \"Description:\" or \"of\" in the above strings is ever localized, so they should be parsed out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"DHTML_Accessibility_is_Supported\" name=\"DHTML_Accessibility_is_Supported\">DHTML Accessibility is Supported</h3>\n\n<div class=\"indent\">\n<p>This means that you may encounter roles that are not typically in HTML content. Be prepared for new combinations of roles and states in content, such as ROLE_SLIDER, ROLE_PROGRESSBAR and STATE_REQUIRED. In addition, check the STATE_FOCUSABLE bit on tables, which indicates a traversable DHTML spreadsheet. Please see the <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML\">DHTML accessibility documentation page</a> for more information on this topic.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"IAccessibles_Persist\" name=\"IAccessibles_Persist\">IAccessibles Persist</h3>\n\n<div class=\"indent\">\n<p>Unless the document changes, retrieving the IAccessible more than once for the same object will return the same IAccessible*. The uniqueID will remain the same as well. If the document does change, EVENT_REORDER, EVENT_HIDE and EVENT_SHOW are used to indicate where the changes will occur. Because of the persistence, relations and events can be mapped within an assistive technology's internal model.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"Page_Loading_is_Tracked_via_STATE_CHANGE_events\" name=\"Page_Loading_is_Tracked_via_STATE_CHANGE_events\">Page Loading is Tracked via STATE_CHANGE events</h3>\n\n<div class=\"indent\">\n<p>When a new document is about to be loaded, an EVENT_STATE_CHANGE occurs on the root ROLE_DOCUMENT object for a window. The STATE_BUSY flag is now set for the root pane object.</p>\n\n<p>Once the new page is ready to be displayed and traversed via its IAccessible tree, the old content window is destroyed, and a new window is created. Next, another EVENT_STATE_CHANGE is fired for the new root ROLE_DOCUMENT object for the window, with its STATE_BUSY flag cleared.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p> </p>",
