If the accessible has an name you can get the <a href=\"/en/nsIAccessible\" title=\"en/nsIAccessible\">nsIAccessible</a> that it was labelled by in order to get more formatting information. Note that the label and description (see RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY) relations may be used to prevent redundant information from being presented by the screen reader, since the label and description can occur both on their own, and in the name or description fields of an <a href=\"/en/nsIAccessible\" title=\"en/nsIAccessible\">nsIAccessible</a>.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_LABEL_FOR</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_MEMBER_OF\">RELATION_MEMBER_OF</dt>\n <dd>This object is a member of a group of one or more objects. When there is more than one object in the group each member may have one and the same target, e.g. a grouping object. It is also possible that each member has multiple additional targets, e.g. one for every other member in the group.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF\">RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF</dt>\n <dd>This object is a child of a target object.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_FLOWS_TO\">RELATION_FLOWS_TO</dt>\n <dd>Content flows from this object to a target object, i.e. has content that flows logically to another object in a sequential way, e.g. text flow.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_FLOWS_FROM</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_FLOWS_FROM\">RELATION_FLOWS_FROM</dt>\n <dd>Content flows to this object from a target object, i.e. has content that flows logically from another object in a sequential way, e.g. text flow.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_FLOWS_TO</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_SUBWINDOW_OF\">RELATION_SUBWINDOW_OF</dt>\n <dd>This object is a sub window of a target object.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_EMBEDS\">RELATION_EMBEDS</dt>\n <dd>This object embeds a target object. This relation can be used on the OBJID_CLIENT accessible for a top level window to show where the content areas are. It points to the accessible object corresponding to the root of content in that window. This relation is very useful for finding the content quickly, and is the proper method for finding content in Firefox 3 and beyond.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_EMBEDDED_BY</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_EMBEDDED_BY\">RELATION_EMBEDDED_BY</dt>\n <dd>This object is embedded by a target object.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_EMBEDS</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_POPUP_FOR\">RELATION_POPUP_FOR</dt>\n <dd>This object is a transient component related to the target object.

If the accessible has an description, you can get the <a href=\"/en/nsIAccessible\" title=\"en/nsIAccessible\">nsIAccessible</a> that it was described by in order to get more formatting information. Note that the label (see RELATION_LABELLED_BY) and description relations may be used to prevent redundant information from being presented by the screen reader, since the label and description can occur both on their own, and in the name or description fields of an <a href=\"/en/nsIAccessible\" title=\"en/nsIAccessible\">nsIAccessible</a>.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR\">RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR</dt>\n <dd>This object is describes the target object.</dd>\n <dd>Applied to: ???</dd>\n <dd>Opposite relation: RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY</dd>\n <dt id=\"RELATION_DEFAULT_BUTTON\">RELATION_DEFAULT_BUTTON</dt>\n <dd>Part of a form/dialog with a related default button.
