    "content": "<p><strong>Mork</strong> was the name David McCusker gave to a text file format at Netscape. It was used for address books and history files under Mozilla when the mail/news team first released an open source version of the mail user agent. It's still used currently but has been replaced in Firefox 3 by <a href=\"en/Places\">Places</a>/SQLite (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383833\" title=\"FIXED: eliminate toolkit's mork-based history implementation\">bugÂ 383833</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Mork name comes from the famous '80 TV series \"Mork &amp; Mindy\".</p>\n\n<p>Mork uses markup in a plain text format to describe uninterpreted binary content. Describing Mork as a text format is slightly inaccurate.</p>\n\n<p>Mork is really a binary format encoded in a stream of byte oriented markup. But the binary is escaped when needed to avoid confusing the plain text markup.</p>\n\n<p>Mork does not understand Unicode, which looks like any other binary to Mork.</p>\n\n<p>Mork was intended as a temporary open source stub implementation of the abstract MDB interface, which was a generalization of mail database features desired for the mail/news and address book clients.</p>\n\n<p>However, even as a mere short term stub, Mork aimed to avoid pain points for users and developers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>avoid user data loss and corruption if and when incremental writes are interrupted</li>\n <li>avoid extreme unreadability by writing line-oriented output with continuations.</li>\n <li>avoid a fixed schema, and permit anything at all to be flexibly added later</li>\n <li>avoid extra bytes in markup whenever possible for i/o and space efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last goal could have been done better in the way binary is escaped. The early version was verbose given heavy doses of non-ascii octets. Adding base64 support was never a priority to management.</p>\n\n<p></p><div class=\"originaldocinfo\">\n<h2 id=\"Original_Document_Information\" name=\"Original_Document_Information\">Original Document Information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Author(s): David McCusker</li>\n<li>Original Location: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.erys.org/resume/netscape/mork/mork.html_(&lt;a_href='&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20050324235032/http://erys.org/resume/netscape/mork/mork.html&quot;'_class='&quot;external&quot;'>archive.org_version&lt;/a>,_original_website_is_404/Not_Found)\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.erys.org/resume/netscape/mork/mork.html (&lt;a href='\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050324235032/http://erys.org/resume/netscape/mork/mork.html\"' class='\"external\"'&gt;archive.org version&lt;/a&gt;, original website is 404/Not Found)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div><p></p>",
