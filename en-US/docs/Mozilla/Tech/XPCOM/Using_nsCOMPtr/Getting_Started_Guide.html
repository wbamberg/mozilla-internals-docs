 ?
</h4>
<p>
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is a tool to help prevent leaks.
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is a "smart pointer". It is a template class that acts, syntactically, just like an ordinary pointer in C or C++, i.e., you can apply
 <code>
  *
 </code>
 or
 <code>
  -&gt;
 </code>
 to it to "get to" what it points at.
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is smart in that, unlike a raw C++ pointer to an XPCOM object,
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 manages
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ,
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 , and
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 for you.
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is defined in the source files:

<p>
 ...though you probably don't want to look in there, just yet.

 With

 , you can write code that is shorter, cleaner, clearer, and safer, than you can with raw XPCOM interface pointers.

 This is a quick refresher on some fundamental issues of XPCOM. You should already know this, and should be able to just skim this short section. If this is unfamiliar material, you're not ready for

<p>
 All XPCOM objects are allocated on the heap. Clients don't get to know much about the implementation of any such object. They reference it only through a pointer to an `interface', i.e., the static type of the pointer is a pointer to an abstract base class, the actual object pointed to is a class derived from that abstract base class. The XPCOM object is said to `implement that interface'. The client's reference to the object is typically called `an interface pointer'.
</p>
<p>
 An object may implement many interfaces. Each interface is (at least conceptually) separately `reference counted'. That is, the interface keeps a count of the number of clients holding references to it. When that count goes to zero, the interface may
 <code>
  delete
 </code>
 itself. Clients are expected to keep this reference count accurate by incrementing it when they acquire a reference to the interface, and decrementing it before they let go. To facilitate this, all interfaces inherit from an abstract base class that provides the member functions
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 , and
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 A rule of XPCOM is that any function that creates or returns an interface pointer will have already
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed it. The caller can then hold onto the reference indefinitely, calling
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 when it no longer needs it. When the last pointer to an interface is
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 d, the interface (and consequently, typically the underlying object) will
 <code>
  delete
 </code>
 itself. As long as there is an outstanding
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 against the interface, it continues to exist. If you forget to call
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 , the object will leak, i.e., the storage for that object will never be reclaimed. Leaks are bad
 <code>
  <span class="nowiki">
   :-)
  </span>
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 A reference through which you will call
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 is called an
 <strong>
  owning reference
 </strong>
 . It holds a stake in the underlying object. That object cannot go away until the owning reference has relinquished its claim. Not all references need to be owning references. In fact, if two objects somehow end up owning each other (even transitively) it becomes difficult for either of those object to be reclaimed without adding some `out-of-band' mechanism for breaking the ownership cycle. The document
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/XPCOM_ownership_guidelines">
  Some COM Ownership Guidelines
 </a>
 provides some hints on when ownership is needed. The following lists are good starting point, but by no means complete.
</p>
<p>
 You use an owning reference when
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  you created the object;
 </li>
 <li>
  you got the object from a function that
  <em>
   might
  </em>
  have created it, e.g., any `getter' function, such as
  <code>
   QueryInterface
  </code>
  , or
  <code>
   CreateInstance
  </code>
  . All good getters
  <code>
   AddRef
  </code>
  the interface pointers they produce, thus providing you with an owning reference;
 </li>
 <li>
  you will hold onto the reference longer than the scope of the function in which you acquired it, e.g., you got it as a parameter, but you're hanging onto it in a member variable (see, for example,
  <a href="#Comparison_1">
   Comparison 1
  </a>
  , below).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 You don't need an owning reference when
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  the object is passed in as a parameter, and you
  <em>
   don't
  </em>
  need to keep it any longer than the scope of this function;
 </li>
 <li>
  the object's lifetime is known to contain yours in some well defined way, e.g., in the nodes of a tree, parent nodes keep owning references to their children, children need not keep owning references to their parents.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 It turns out that reference counting by hand is hard for programmers to get right. It may sound simple, but in practice it's very easy to forget to
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 at the appropriate moment. Or to
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 too many or too few times.

<h4 id="How_does_nsCOMPtr_help.3F" name="How_does_nsCOMPtr_help.3F">
 How does
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 help?
</h4>
<p>
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 manages
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ,
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 , and other red-tape for you. An
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 looks and acts as much like a raw XPCOM interface pointer as C allows, but it knows it owns the object it points to. This takes a little getting used to on your part, but ends up with less typing, clearer, safer code, and less leaks.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, here is a typical snippet of code (at its most compact) where you assign a XPCOM interface pointer into a member variable, i.e., the body of a `setter' function, side-by-side using raw XPCOM interface pointers and
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 s.

   |NULL|; assign it in; and |Release|

   leak it).

   and must be used to avoid particular
   ownership bugs.
 */

NS_IF_ADDREF(aFooPtr);
nsIFoo* temp = mFooPtr;
mFooPtr = aFooPtr;
NS_IF_RELEASE(temp);
</pre>
   </td>
   <td>
    <pre class="brush: cpp">

/*
   This assignment automatically

   to avoid the ownership bug mentioned
   earlier.
 */



mFooPtr = aFooPtr;





</pre>
   </td>
  </tr>

<p>
 Additionally, the class using raw XPCOM interface pointers will need a destructor to
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 <code>
  mFooPtr
 </code>
 <span class="nowiki">
  ; and a constructor to ensure that
  <code>
   mFooPtr
  </code>
  is initially set to
  <code>
   NULL
  </code>
  (or some other reasonable value).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 helps you write code that is leak-proof, exception safe, and significantly less verbose than you would with raw XPCOM interface pointers. With
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 , you may never have to call
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ,
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 , or
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 by hand.
</p>
<p>
 You still have to understand XPCOM. You still have to know which functions return interface pointers that have already been
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed and which don't. You still have to ensure your program logic doesn't produce circularly referencing garbage.
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is not a panacea. It is, however, helpful, easy to use, well-tested, and polite. It doesn't require that a function author cooperate with you, nor does your use force others to use it.

 Second: you can't just pass the address of an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 to a getter expecting to return a result through a raw XPCOM interface pointer parameter. You have to `annotate' the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 with the
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual">
  <code>
   getter_AddRefs

 That's it. You now know enough to start using

 A Few Details
</h4>
<p>
 There are a couple more things that will help you get the most out of
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Very often, you first get an interface pointer by calling
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 .
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 is a getter like any other, and you already know one way to call it, applying the
 <code>
  getter_AddRefs
 </code>
 rule, as described above.

</table>
<p>
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 is used so frequently, though, that
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 has a special facility to call it. This facility is type-safe, and it enables an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 to be directly constructed from the result of
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 . Construction from the correct value is more efficient that construction followed by assignment. This facility is the
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual">
  <code>
   do_QueryInterface

 directive. Using
 <code>

 <em>
  not

 extended to
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 .
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 does not
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 on assignment without your explicit permission in the form of the
 <code>
  do_QueryInterface
 </code>
 directive. You need never worry about hidden queries. However, be aware that if you
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 have queried but didn't, e.g., when assigning in a raw pointer where C++ allows the assignment, but XPCOM wouldn't,

<p>
 Remember, the C++ type system and the XPCOM type system are really two independent things. Because XPCOM interfaces are expressed as abstract C++ base classes, you may be tempted to let C++ handle the differences, or to use C++ casts to navigate between interface types. This is wrong. The only sanctioned way to get between XPCOM types is with
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 . In the example above, there is no reason to assume that the
 <code>
  nsIFoo*
 </code>
 C++ pulls out of
 <code>
  p

 would be the same one that
 <code>
  p-&gt;QueryInterface()

 Plainly, the author believed (though perhaps with some question) that the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 ,
 <code>
  mFileSpec
 </code>
 , would
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 automatically as it was assigned into
 <code>
  <span class="nowiki">
   *aFileSpec
  </span>
 </code>
 . This is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 the case. An
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 automatically calls
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 (only) on its
 <em>
  own
 </em>
 behalf. In all other situations, it is designed to be a drop in replacement for a raw XPCOM pointer. Where ever an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is used in a situation where a raw pointer is needed, the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 automatically provides one.

<p>
 In all of these cases, pretty much the exact same code is executed (case 2 is slightly different, but the intent is the same). In each case, you are essentially extracting the raw pointer value for your own purpose. If the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed the value each time you did that, cases 4 and 5 would obviously always generate leaks.
 <code>
  SetFoo
 </code>
 , from case 3, would have to be written two different ways when given an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 , it would know the value was already
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed, and when given a raw pointer it would assume the value was not
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed. Actually the contradictions run deeper than that. All these cases show that automatically
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ing on `output' makes
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 s and raw-pointers act differently from the point of view of the clients. The goal is to make them act the same so that
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 s can be a drop in replacement (modulo managing its own `ownership').
</p>
<p>
 Given what you now know, the rule is predictable. As described above, and unless you tell it otherwise, an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 s when you assign
 <em>
  in
 </em>
 to it. It does nothing when you assign
 <em>
  out
 </em>
 of it.

 You should use an

 any place you use an interface pointer as an owning reference, i.e., where you call
 <code>

 <code>
  Release

 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 as a member variable, where it will simplify setters, and eliminate constructors, destructors, and assignment operators. You should use

 on the stack, where it makes calling
 <code>

 almost pleasant, and eliminates the complex logic that falls out of error handling.

 s in function signatures
</h4>
<p>
 In general, you won't want to use
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 in the signature of XPCOM (i.e., `scriptable') functions.
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is not currently directly supported by IDL. However, you may sometime be tempted to use an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 in a non-scriptable function.

<h5 id="nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_f.28.29_don.27t_return_an_nsCOMPtr" name="nsCOMPtr.3CT.3E_f.28.29_don.27t_return_an_nsCOMPtr">
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr&lt;T&gt; f()
 </code>
 don't return an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
</h5>
<p>
 This practice is dangerous. Returning an
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed pointer in almost any form as a function result leads to several potential errors, some of which are leaks, some of which are dangling pointers. Returning an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 may seem like a good idea (since it tells clients you are giving them ownership), however it can be the cause of an dangling pointer. Consider:
</p>
<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <pre class="brush: cpp">
// Don't return |nsCOMPtr|s...
nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; CreateFoo();
// ...

nsIFoo* myFoo = CreateFoo(); // Oops: |myFoo| now dangles!
  // |CreateFoo| returns an |nsCOMPtr|, which
  //  automatically |Release|s right after this
  //  assignment.  Now |myFoo| refers to a
  //  deleted object.
</pre>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
<p>
 You can tell callers you are giving them ownership in a way that doesn't pose this hazard by returning a
 <code>
  already_AddRefed&lt;T&gt;
 </code>
 (see bug
 <a class="external" href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59212">
  <span class="nowiki">
   #59212
  </span>
 </a>
 ). An
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 knows not to
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 a value that is
 <code>
  already_AddRefed
 </code>
 .
</p>
<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <pre class="brush: cpp">
// Preferred form: if you must return a pointer, use |already_AddRefed|...
already_AddRefed&lt;nsIFoo&gt; CreateFoo();
// ...

nsIFoo* myFoo1 = CreateFoo(); // doesn't dangle
nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; myFoo2( CreateFoo() ); // doesn't leak
nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; myFoo3( dont_AddRef(CreateFoo()) ); // redundant, but legal and correct
</pre>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
<p>
 Compare this to the most frequent leaks caused by returning a raw pointer you have already
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed:
</p>
<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <pre class="brush: cpp">
// Don't return raw pointers; that incites leaks...
nsIFoo* CreateFoo(); // returns an |AddRef|ed pointer
// ...

nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; myFoo = CreateFoo(); // Oops: leak;
nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; myFoo( dont_AddRef(CreateFoo()) );
  // Since |CreateFoo| already |AddRef|s its result, we must remind
  //  our |nsCOMPtr| not to.  It's easy to forget.  Prevent it in advance
  //  by not returning pointers as function results, or else by returning
  //  an |already_AddRefed&lt;T&gt;| as above.
</pre>

<p>
 This practice is wasteful, but not otherwise harmful. There is no need to
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 parameters, as they are guaranteed to live as long as the function call. You only need to
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 them as you store them in a structure that will live longer than the function call. Which means the appropriate member of that structure should be an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 , not the function parameter. Additionally, this signature may confuse callers into thinking they need an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 just to call the function.

 <code>

<p>
 This practice requires callers to have an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr

 , and requires them to do a little extra work, as
 <code>
  operator&amp;
 </code>
 for
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr

 s is

<table>

</h5>
<p>
 This is the prefered scheme for providing `in/out' parameters. If you were to use a raw pointer instead, your function couldn't know what ownership relationship the caller had to the input value, and hence, couldn't know whether to
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 it or not before assigning in the new value. By declaring the parameter as an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr&amp;
 </code>
 , the relationship is explicit.
</p>
<h3 id="Summary" name="Summary">
 Summary
</h3>
<p>
 An
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is an owning reference. Whatever it points to has been
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed, counting the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 as one of its `owners'. An
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 always calls
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 before letting go, whether the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is letting go so that it can point to a different object, or because the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 is going out of scope. Any time a new value is assigned into an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 , the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 automatically always
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 s its old referent, if any, and (unless you tell it you already have)
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 s the new.
</p>
<p>
 You use an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 exactly as you would a raw XPCOM interface pointer in almost all cases. You won't have to explictly call
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 or
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 through it, nor will the compiler allow it. The only place you can't use an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 without change is where a raw XPCOM interface pointer is an `out' parameter. In this case, you wrap the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 with
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual">
  <code>
   getter_AddRefs
  </code>
 </a>
 (see
 <a href="#">
  Comparison 4
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 When assigning into an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 , you will usually just supply another pointer (either a raw XPCOM interface pointer or an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 ), with no additional directives (see, e.g., the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 side of
 <a href="#Comparison_1">
  Comparison 1
 </a>
 ). As stated above, with no directives, the
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 will
 <code>
  Release
 </code>
 its old referent, if any, and
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 the new. This is appropriate when the thing you're assigning in hasn't yet been
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed to account for the new reference. This is typically the case when you are assigning in a pointer that you
 <em>
  didn't
 </em>
 call a function to get, e.g., one that was passed in as a parameter, or that you pulled out of a structure.
</p>
<p>
 You can tell
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 it doesn't need to
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 the new value on assignment by wrapping the new value in
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual">
  <code>
   dont_AddRef
  </code>
 </a>
 . Do this, for example, when you got the new value from a function which, like all good XPCOM getters, already called
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
 You may not assign in a pointer to a different interface type; you must first query it to the right type (see, e.g.,
 <a href="#Comparison_6">
  Comparison 6
 </a>
 and the surrounding discussion).
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 <em>
  never
 </em>
 calls
 <code>
  QueryInterface
 </code>
 implicitly, i.e., you must call it yourself, or explictly ask
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 to call it with
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual">
  <code>
   do_QueryInterface
  </code>
 </a>
 . The
 <code>
  do_QueryInterface
 </code>
 directive allows you to do the query as part of the assignment. This better facilitates constructing an
 <code>
  nsCOMPtr
 </code>
 directly from the right value, rather than constructing it and assigning in the correct value later. Construction alone is more efficient than construction followed by assignment. Prefer construction over assignment whereever reasonable. Be careful not to apply
 <code>
  do_QueryInterface
 </code>
 to a function returning an
 <code>
  AddRef
 </code>
 ed pointer (see
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Using_nsCOMPtr/Reference_Manual">

 </a>
 for an explanation)
