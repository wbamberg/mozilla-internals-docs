<p>
 The following are topics that you can observe during the course of an application. Unless otherwise noted you register for the topics using the
 <code>
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIObserverService" title="">
   nsIObserverService
  </a>
 </code>
 .
</p>
<h3 id="Application_startup" name="Application_startup">
 Application startup
</h3>
<p>
 These are the topics that you can observe on startup, in order of appearance.
</p>
<p>
 If your component requires access to the user profile, or any services which require access to the profile (preferences, bookmarks, and so on) then a common pattern is to register with the
 <code>
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsICategoryManager" title="">
   nsICategoryManager
  </a>
 </code>
 for the app-startup topic which can be done in the component's registration code, and then in that notification register with the observer service for the profile-after-change notification. See
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Guide/Receiving_startup_notifications" title="en/XPCOM/Receiving startup notifications">
  Receiving startup notifications
 </a>
 for more information about how this works.
</p>
<p>
 Starting in Firefox 3.5 components can simply register for the profile-after-change notification in
 <code>
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsICategoryManager" title="">
   nsICategoryManager

 </code>

 If you're using a
 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox/Message_Manager">
  message manager
 </a>
 to communicate with a script that may be running in a different process, you might need to know when the message manager has disconnected from the other end of the conversation, so you can stop sending it messages or expecting to receive messages.
</p>
<p>
 For example, suppose you've loaded a frame script into a tab using a
 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox/Message_Manager">
  browser message manager
 </a>
 , and the user closes the tab. The frame script is unloaded and the browser message manager disconnects from it. By listening for
 <code>
  message-manager-disconnect
 </code>
 you will be informed when this happens.
